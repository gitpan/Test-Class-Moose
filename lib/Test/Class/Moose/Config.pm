=head1 NAME

Test::Class::Moose::Config - Configuration information for Test::Class::Moose

=head1 VERSION

version 0.08

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $tc_config = Test::Class::Moose::Config->new({
     show_timing => 1,
     builder     => Test::Builder->new,
     statistics  => 1,
     randomize   => 0,
 });
 my $test_suite = Test::Class::Moose->new($tc_config);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For internal use only (maybe I'll expose it later). Not guaranteed to be
stable.

This class defines many of the attributes for L<Test::Class::Moose>. They're
kept here to minimize namespace pollution in L<Test::Class::Moose>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 * C<show_timing>

Boolean. Will display verbose information on the amount of time it takes each
test class/test method to run.

=head2 * C<statistics>

Boolean. Will display number of classes, test methods and tests run.

=head2 * C<use_environment>

Boolean.  Sets show_timing and statistics to true if your test harness is running verbosely, false otherwise.

=head2 C<builder>

Usually defaults to C<< Test::Builder->new >>, but you could substitute your
own if it conforms to the interface.

=head2 C<randomize>

Boolean. Will run tests in a random order.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<args>

 my $tests = Some::Test::Class->new($test_suite->test_configuration->args);

Returns a hash reference of the args used to build the configuration. Used in
testing. You probably won't need it.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests to C<bug-test-class-moose at rt.cpan.org>,
or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Test-Class-Moose>.  I will be
notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of progress on your bug as
I make changes.
