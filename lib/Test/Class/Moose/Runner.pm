=head1 NAME

Test::Class::Moose::Runner - Runner for Test::Class::Moose tests

=head1 VERSION

version 0.56

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Test::Class::Moose::Load 't/lib';
 use Test::Class::Moose::Runner;
 Test::Class::Moose::Runner->new->runtests;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is responsible for running tests. Internally, most of the work is
done by either a C<Test::Class::Moose::Executor::Sequential> or
C<Test::Class::Moose::Executor::Parallel> object.

=head1 LOADING TESTS

We I<strongly> recommend using the L<Test::Class::Moose::Load> driver for your
test suite. Simply point it at the directory or directories containing your
test classes:

 use Test::Class::Moose::Load 't/lib';
 use Test::Class::Moose::Runner;
 Test::Class::Moose::Runner->new->runtests;

By running your C<Test::Class::Moose> tests with a single driver script like
this, all classes are loaded once and this can be a significant performance
boost. This does mean a global state will be shared, so keep this in mind.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item * C<show_timing>

Boolean. Will display verbose information on the amount of time it takes each
test class/test method to run. Defaults to false, but see C<use_environment>.

=item * C<statistics>

Boolean. Will display number of classes, test methods and tests run. Defaults
to false, but see C<use_environment>.

=item * C<use_environment>

If this is true, then the default value for show_timing and statistics will be
true if the C<HARNESS_IS_VERBOSE> environment variable is true. This is set
when running C<prove -v ...>, for example.

=item * C<jobs>

This defaults to 1. If you set this to a larger number than test instances
will be run in parallel. See the L</PARALLEL RUNNING> section below for more
details.

=item * C<randomize>

Boolean. Will run test methods in a random order.

=item * C<builder>

Defaults to C<< Test::Builder->new >>. You can supply your own builder if you
want, but it must conform to the L<Test::Builder> interface. We make no
guarantees about which part of the interface it needs.

=item * C<test_classes>

Takes a class name or an array reference of class names. If it is present,
only these test classes will be run. This is very useful if you wish to run an
individual class as a test:

    My::Base::Class->new(
        test_classes => $ENV{TEST_CLASS}, # ignored if undef
    )->runtests;

You can also achieve this effect by writing a subclass and overriding the
C<test_classes> method, but this makes it trivial to do this:

    TEST_CLASS=TestsFor::Our::Company::Invoice prove -lv t/test_classes.t

Alternatively:

    My::Base::Class->new(
        test_classes => \@ARGV, # ignored if empty
    )->runtests;

That lets you use the arisdottle to provide arguments to your test driver
script:

    prove -lv t/test_classes.t :: TestsFor::Our::Company::Invoice TestsFor::Something::Else

=item * C<include>

Regex. If present, only test methods whose name matches C<include> will be
included. B<However>, they must still start with C<test_>.

For example:

 my $test_suite = Test::Class::Moose->new({
     include => qr/customer/,
 });

The above constructor will let you match test methods named C<test_customer>
and C<test_customer_account>, but will not suddenly match a method named
C<default_customer>.

By enforcing the leading C<test_> behavior, we don't surprise developers who
are trying to figure out why C<default_customer> is being run as a test. This
means an C<include> such as C<< /^customer.*/ >> will never run any tests.

=item * C<exclude>

Regex. If present, only test methods whose names don't match C<exclude> will be
included. B<However>, they must still start with C<test_>. See C<include>.

=item * C<include_tags>

Array ref of strings matching method tags (a single string is also ok). If
present, only test methods whose tags match C<include_tags> or whose tags
don't match C<exclude_tags> will be included. B<However>, they must still
start with C<test_>.

For example:

 my $test_suite = Test::Class::Moose->new({
     include_tags => [qw/api database/],
 });

The above constructor will only run tests tagged with C<api> or C<database>.

=item * C<exclude_tags>

The same as C<include_tags>, but will exclude the tests rather than include
them. For example, if your network is down:

 my $test_suite = Test::Class::Moose->new({
     exclude_tags => [ 'network' ],
 });

 # or
 my $test_suite = Test::Class::Moose->new({
     exclude_tags => 'network',
 });

=head1 METHODS

In addition to the C<new> method, this class provides several  additional
public methods

=head2 C<< $runner->runtests >>

This method runs your tests. It accepts no arguments.

=head2 C<< $runner->test_configuration >>

This returns a L<Test::Class::Moose::Config> for the runner.

Most of the attributes passed to the runner are actually available in a
L<Test::Class::Moose::Config> rather than the runner itself. This may change
in a future release, in which case this method will simply return the runner
itself for backwards compatibility.

=head1 PARALLEL RUNNING

Running tests in parallel requires you to have L<Parallel::ForkManager>
installed. This is not a prereq of this distro so you will need to install
manually.

To run tests in parallel, simply pass a value greater than 1 for the C<jobs>
parameter when creating a runner object:

  Test::Class::Moose::Runner->new( jobs => 4 )->runtests;

Your test classes will be run in parallel in separate child processes. Test
classes are parallelized on a B<per instance basis>. This means that each
child process constructs a single instance of a test class and runs all of
the methods belonging to that class.

If you are using parameterized test instances (see the L<Test::Class::Moose>
docs for details) then the same class may have instances running in different
child processes.

If any of the methods in a class are marked with the C<noparallel> tag, then
that class will be not be run in a child process. All test classes which can't
be run in parallel are run sequentially after all parallelizable classes have
run.
